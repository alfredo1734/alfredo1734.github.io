  <h1>Information About Me</h1>
  <p>I was born on 12/23/03 in Castro Valley. When I was 3 years old I lived in Tara Hills near Richmond and Hercules
    and went to Tara Hills Elementary School. I started playing baseball at the Tara Hills Baseball Park.
    When I turned 7 we moved to Oakland. I went to Lazear Elementary school but after 2nd grade the school turned
    charter and my mom put us in Think College Now or TCN. Once I was promoted I went to Urban Promise Academy for
    middle school. After I finished middle school I went to Skyline High School which is where I am currently attending high school.</p>

  <h2>Favorite Thing To Do</h2>
  <p>I like to play baseball. I have been playing baseball ever since I was 3 years old at Tara Hills Baseball Park.
  I play in a tournament atleast once every summer from when I was 7-12 years old. After that I got tired of baseball
  so I took a break. Now I play for Skyline on the baseball team.</p>
